    <h2>Document Text</h2>
    <p>Understanding and navigating large collections of docu- ments has become an important activity in many spheres. However, many document collections are not coherently or- ganized and organizing them by hand is impractical. We need automated ways to discover and visualize the structure of a collection in order to more easily explore its contents.
Probabilistic topic modeling is a set of machine learning tools that may provide a solution (Blei and Lafferty 2009). Topic modeling algorithms discover a hidden thematic struc- ture in a collection of documents; they find salient themes and represent each document as a combination of themes.
However, topic models are high-level statistical tools. A user must scrutinize numerical distributions to understand and explore their results; the raw output of the model is not enough to create an easily explored corpus.</p>
